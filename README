                          Dark Shadows - The Roguelike

 "My name is Victoria Winters. The time for darkness and for sleep has come to
    Collinwood, but lights blaze from her many windows and sleep is still a
 stranger. Voices, angry voices, frightened voices reverberate through the long
                       halls and the air is very cold...
           cold with a long-felt fear... cold with a long-felt rage."
